# Mechanical Maniacs Website – Elementary Workshop Plan

## Goal
Help elementary students understand how the Mechanical Maniacs website works and empower them to improve it with their own ideas, writing, and style choices.

---

## Session 1 – Story Tour & Language Explorer (30–40 mins)
1. **Welcome demo**
   - Show the home page and explain that it’s like the cover of a book about the team.
   - Ask students what parts they notice first (hero title, stats, buttons).
2. **Language buttons**
   - Click each flag and have volunteers read the headline in different languages.
   - Explain that the computer is swapping “labels” behind the scenes.
3. **Hands-on mini-task**
   - In small groups, have students write a short welcome sentence on paper.
   - Discuss which sentence would make a friendly headline and why.

**Facilitator tip:** Connect everything to storytelling—each page is a different chapter. Keep vocabulary simple: “buttons,” “boxes,” “stickers” for badges, etc.

## Session 2 – Artifact Detectives (45 mins)
1. **Grid scavenger hunt**
   - Visit `artifacts.html`, click tiles, and play the new “Listen to description” button.
   - Ask students to close their eyes while listening and draw the object they imagine.
2. **Student challenge (pre-added in code)**
   - Show the commented-out artifact template (search for “Student Challenge” comment).
   - Explain how to duplicate/fill it using a short description they create.
3. **Pair work**
   - Pairs invent a new artifact (real or fictional), write a two-sentence story, and plan an emoji/Image they could add later.

**Outcome:** Students learn that each artifact has a number, title, date/location, and description. They practice structured writing.

## Session 3 – Team & Design Remix (45 mins)
1. **Team gallery review**
   - Open `team.html` and read a few teammate blurbs aloud.
   - Discuss what other roles or hobbies could appear on the team.
2. **Student challenge**
   - Reveal the commented-out teammate card and have students fill it with their own role idea (“Music Maestro,” “Safety Scout,” etc.).
3. **Color experiment (optional)**
   - Highlight the commented CSS color block in `assets/styles.css` that kids can tweak with color pickers.
   - Let them preview changes using a sandbox or by telling an adult what color variables to swap.

**Wrap-up idea:** Host a mini “gallery walk” where students show their new card or artifact description and explain why it helps visitors.

## Collaboration Tips
- **Use sticky notes:** Kids can place ideas where they want text or pictures to change.
- **Jobs rotation:** Assign “Navigator” (mouse/keyboard) and “Spotter” (reads instructions) roles to keep everyone engaged.
- **Celebrate small wins:** Every updated sentence or translated phrase is a contribution to the team story.

## Where to Edit (Quick Reference)
- `index.html` – Hero message and navigation labels.
- `artifacts.html` – Artifact grid + modal text (with a student template).
- `team.html` – Team bios (student template to add friends/mentors).
- `assets/styles.css` – Colors and layout (look for the “Student Palette Experiment” comment).
- `assets/script.js` – Advanced area for grown-ups (handles language switch + text-to-speech).

Encourage curiosity, keep edits bite-sized, and remind students that websites are living stories they can help tell!
